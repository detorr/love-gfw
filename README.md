# `Linux` or `MacOS` in one hit

<div align=center><img width="700" src="img/punch.gif"/></div>



The 360 degree painless patriotic routing scheme has emerged in endlessly, but we have to face a very real problem: 

** You can't go anywhere with a router! **

To solve this problem, this tutorial was born. The goal is to teach you how to automatically cross the Great Wall 360 degrees without dead corners on different operating systems. Clap:

PS: At present, it can only be implemented on Linux and MacOS systems. Windows
Users please ÊªöÔºÅÂòªÂòªÂòª üòÅ

## Characteristics of Patriotic Program in this tutorial
Give up the blacklist scheme. The number of websites on the wall is increasing dramatically every day. Limited life can not be spent in endless manual blacklisting and restarting devices.

+ Establish a list of important websites in China and conduct DNS inquiries in China
+ Other websites query DNS from `shadowsocks'client to `shadowsocks' server
+ Domestic or Asian IP traffic flows through domestic channels
+ Other traffic is forwarded through `shadowsocks'server

## Knowledge is meaningless if it is not shared.

This document does not cover the principles and basic configurations of `shadowsocks'. If you don't even grasp these basic knowledge, please turn left and take a detour. Learn these basic knowledge and then come back to this tutorial.

> There are two ways to achieve global intelligent shunting, one is through the firewall strategy, the other is through the policy routing table.

## Realization through Firewall Policy
There are many kinds of firewall tools. I have tried and successfully implemented two kinds of functions, one is `iptables', the other is `nftables'. ` iptables should be familiar to everyone. nftables may be unfamiliar to most people. If you want to know more, please refer to [the reason why Linux first introduced nftables, you might like nftables] (http://blog.jobbole.com/59624/).

** Unfortunately, this solution is not applicable to the MacOS system. If you have any good suggestions, please give me some help. **

### 1. Intelligent shunting through iptables
The idea of this scheme is to use `ipset'to load the IP list of chnroute and `iptables' to realize the global proxy with automatic diversion of domestic and foreign traffic.

+ [Linux Á≥ªÁªü](./docs/iptables-linux.md)
+ MacOS System: Not yet implemented. For similar solutions, please refer to [A project based on VirtualBox and openwrt is designed to realize macOS/Windows Transparent Agent of Platform](https://github.com/icymind/VRouter)

### 2. Adopt nftables Realizing Intelligent Divergence

+ [Linux System](./docs/nftables-linux.md)
+ MacOS System: Not yet implemented

## Implementation by Policy Routing Table

The general idea of this scheme is to start a local `socks'proxy, then disguise `socks' proxy as `vpn'through tools, and then distribute it through policy routing.

There are two tools to disguise `socks'agents as `vpn'.
### 1. Intelligent shunting through badvpn
This paper mainly introduces `tun2socks', which is actually a part of `badvpn'.

` Tun2socks `implements a mechanism that allows you to encapsulate data in a completely transparent `socks'protocol without changing any application, forward it to a `socks' agent, which is then responsible for forwarding application data between the agent and the real server.

There are two ways to use proxy. One is to configure proxy explicitly by yourself. In this way, when data leaves your host, its target address is the proxy server.

The other is to act as a transparent proxy, that is, to redirect the original data to an application in the middle and forward it by the proxy agent.

` Tun2socks `completes the encapsulation of the `socks'protocol on the basis of the second one, and uses a powerful `tun' network card to implement the mechanism without having to configure complex `iptables'rules.

### 2. ÈÄöËøá gotun2socks ÂÆûÁé∞Êô∫ËÉΩÂàÜÊµÅ

` gotun2socks is actually the `go'language implementation of `badvpn', and is more intelligent. It will automatically add tuntap network card to you at startup and automatically delete the network card at stop, without us adding and deleting it manually. How about a little excitement? 

Have you fallen in love with go language ever since?

## Outside Chapter
Although all these fancy patriotic schemes can achieve global intelligence diversion, they are still too complex and daunting for most people. Most people don't have a strong need for global intelligent shunting, just let some special applications use proxies. Some applications allow you to choose to use proxies, but many applications do not provide this part of the configuration at all. Now, in order to let some software traffic that the original logic does not consider/do not use/cannot configure the agent go through the agent, the system calls can only be hijacked by hook.


Using [Proxifier] (https://www.proxifier.com/) to achieve this function, with the help of Proxifier, you can easily play traffic forwarding through simple configuration even if you don't understand any network principles. Compared with VPN (Virtual Private Network) global proxy, Proxifier's flexible configuration can also achieve some unexpected functions, such as monitoring the traffic of an application or shielding advertisements. Of course, how you use it ultimately depends entirely on your imagination.

In order to better use Proxifier, we use the following schematic diagram to understand the working principle of Proxifier:
1. Proxifier takes over all network request connections in the system after starting.
2. After taking over, network requests are processed by Proxifier configuration rules.
3. Direct (direct) direct access to the external network; Proxy (proxy) handed over the request to the proxy server for processing before connecting to the external network; Block (prohibition) intercepted outgoing requests.

<div align=center><img src="https://ws3.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fz0edczefvj30dp06xdg8.jpg"/></div>
It needs to be pointed out that Proxifier is charged, which is about tens of dollars. We'd better support the genuine version. I also provide a MacOS cracked version: [Proxifier_2.22.1_xclient.info.dmg] (https://www.lanzous.com/i2tv3je). The decompressed password is `xclient.info', and the key is in the unzipped text file. The following usage tutorials are for MacOS users, similar to Windows platforms.

The next three steps of configuration are:
+ Proxy Server Configuration
+ Agent Rule Settings
+ Domain Name Resolution Settings

<div align=center><img width="700" src="https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fz0faoblsej30u00vdjvs.jpg"/></div>

The next two steps of configuration are critical. Configuration errors can lead to proxy failure or circular proxy!

(2) Configuration step 2

+ Click Rules
+ Select localhost and click Edit
+ Add the IP address of the shadowshocks proxy server at Target hosts (for example, 123.123.123)
+ Action Selects Direct (Direct Connection)
+ OK

<div align=center><img width="700" src="https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fz0feaqxvcj30t60tuadn.jpg"/></div>

** Note: This configuration step allows packets sent to the proxy server to pass through to prevent looping proxy errors. **

The configuration is as follows:

<div align=center><img width="700" src="https://ws4.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fz0fhuwiqoj316u03a3zs.jpg"/></div>

(3) Configuration step 3
+ Click DNS
+ Select the second Resolve hostnames through proxy (domain name resolution via proxy server)
+ OK

<div align=center><img width="700" src="https://ws2.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fz0fnrzenij30vq0qggoz.jpg"/></div>

** If you have configured a non-polluting DNS, you can choose Detect DNS settings automatically and use the default DNS. **
+ OK

So far, the agent has been configured. Next, I will give some examples of specific usage scenarios. 

The most commonly used proxy tool in daily work is `git'. In order to make git use proxy compulsively, only one proxy rule needs to be created in Proxifier:
+ Click Rules
+ Click Add
+ Name field fills in Git
+ Fill in `git-remote-https'in the Applications field`
+ Action Selects Proxy SOCKS 5 127.0.0.1:1080

<div align = center > <img width = "700" src="https://ws4.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fz0g2zxu4oj30t60tu41s.jpg"/> </div>

If you don't know what to write in the Applications field, I can teach you a way to find the process of using the agent in Git clone by following commands:

```bash
$ sudo ps -ef|grep git

```

Obviously, `git-remote-https'is the process we're looking for, and if you're not sure, you can add `git' to the Applications field as well.

<div align = center > <img width = "700" src="https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fz0gesufy3j30t60tugox.jpg"/> </div>

Now if you pull the warehouse through `git clone', you can see the detailed connection statistics:
Another typical usage scenario is Docker. The configuration method is similar to git, so I won't demonstrate it. I'll focus on reminding you that the application field value is com. docker. vpnkit. If you're not sure, you can use the wildcard * docker *. The Target Hosts field is filled in gcr.io;*.docker.io.


<div align=center><img width="700" src="https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fz0gscf7gxj30t60tugoz.jpg"/></div>

Come on, let's pull a legendary gcr. IO image that can't be pulled by proxy.

Well, who else?!
Other mysterious applications, such as `brew'and `Slack', can use this method to force the use of agents, you can explore for yourself, goodbye!
